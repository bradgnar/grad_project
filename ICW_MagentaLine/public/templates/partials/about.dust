        The Atlantic Intra Coastal Waterway(AICW/ICW) stretches from Norfolk,
        VA to Miami, FL providing safe passage down the Atlantic coastline. In
         2013, NOAAâ€™s Office of Coast Survey (OCS) published a Federal Register
         notice to indicate that the magenta line would be removed from
         Federal charts, as the magenta line has not been consistently
        maintained.  The goal of this project is to provide a new magenta line
        that can be easily and consistently updated and viewed through modern
        technology.
